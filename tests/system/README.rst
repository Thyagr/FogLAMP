FogLAMP System Tests
********************

System tests are the third category of test in FogLAMP. These test ensures that end to end flow of a FogLAMP system is
working as expected.

A typical example can be ingesting asset data in FogLAMP database, and sending to a cloud system with different set of
configuration rules.

Since these kinds of tests interacts between two or more heterogeneous systems, these are often slow in nature.
